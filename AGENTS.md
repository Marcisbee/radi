- use kebab-case for file names
- use camelCase for variable and function names
- use PascalCase for class names and React components
- use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- use double quotes for strings
- use semicolons at the end of statements
- use trailing commas in multi-line objects and arrays
- use template literals for string interpolation
- do not use default exports, use named exports instead
- write JSDoc comments for functions and classes
- function content should be less than 50 lines
- avoid using `any` type in TypeScript, use specific types instead
- prefer `const` over `let` and `let` over `var`
- use async/await for asynchronous code instead of .then() and .catch()
- use loops like `for...of` or array methods like `.map()`, `.filter()`, and
  `.reduce()` instead of traditional `for` loops
- avoid deeply nested code, refactor into smaller functions if necessary
- use destructuring assignment for objects and arrays
- use css modules for styling React components
- name variables and functions descriptively to convey their purpose
- avoid using inline styles in React components, use CSS classes instead
- prefer code clarity over cleverness
- prefer immutability, avoid mutating objects and arrays directly
- keep comments minimal and only when necessary to explain complex logic
- do not write what or why you did things in comments
- do not use section comments
- test names should clearly describe the expected behavior and be very short
